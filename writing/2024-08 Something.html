  <h1>2024-08 Something</h1>
  <p>A something is written here, about something and also about something else a little bit. Then you can click to see more. And you did! And now the text is very long and long. And it spans across the page, unfolding. Lines after lines after lines. Of non GPT blabber. Isn't that just amazing. Wow. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Then there's the second paragraph. And some text is in it as well. I'm trying to see how does it look on mobile as well on desktop. I've made the typeface a little bit smaller, and I seem to like it more. A lot of people suggest sizes that are way too large in my opinion, especially on mobile, it is just not needed. You keep your screen fairly close to your face anyway, I feel the default 1rem might just be perfect.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Also, I've had a fun idea. Since the image size is directly related to the ammount of colors and data it has, I'd like to make images on this website be fully dithered, which will make them into one-bit images. And if on top of this I don't use png but use webp, it might be super super tiny and load super fast. Not to mention it will look very cool.</p>
